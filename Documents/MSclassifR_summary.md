## 2. Key Functionalities of MSclassifR

### 2.1 Automated Pre-Processing of Mass Spectra

MSclassifR includes comprehensive pre-processing functions to handle raw mass spectrometry data, ensuring high-quality inputs for downstream analysis:
- **Signal Processing (`SignalProcessing`)**:
  - performs intensity transformations (e.g., square root or log), baseline correction (e.g., SNIP), and spectral alignment using robust warping methods.
  - offers smoothing methods such as Wavelet smoothing to enhance data quality.
  - outputs normalized intensity matrices for further statistical analysis.
- **Peak Detection (`PeakDetection`)**:
  - detects significant peaks based on signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).
  - aligns peaks across spectra using configurable tolerance levels for mass alignment.
  - outputs a list of aligned peaks for each spectrum.

These tools automate critical steps, ensuring consistency and reproducibility in mass spectrometry workflows.

### 2.2 Feature Selection: Identifying Discriminant m/z Values

Feature selection is essential for identifying the most informative m/z values that discriminate between categories. MSclassifR provides multiple methods:
- **Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA)**:
  - calculates variable importance based on the reduction in model accuracy when a specific variable is excluded. This method identifies m/z values that significantly contribute to classification.
- **Cross-Validated Permutation (CVP)**:
  - utilizes cross-validation to evaluate variable importance through permuted datasets, ensuring the robustness of selected m/z values. This method is particularly effective for handling noisy data and large datasets.
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) (`SelectionVar`)**:
  - combines with random forests or logistic regression to iteratively remove non-essential features.
- **Sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLSDA) (`SelectionVar`)**:
  - optimizes feature selection by balancing classification error rates.
- **VSURF (Variable Selection Using Random Forests) (`SelectionVar`)**:
  - selects variables based on their predictive importance, reducing the dataset to its most informative features.
- **Statistical Methods (`SelectionVarStat`)**:
  - employs statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Limma) to identify discriminant m/z values.
  - controls false discovery rates using Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments.

These methods ensure the selection of biologically relevant and statistically significant features.

### 2.3 Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification

MSclassifR supports a wide range of machine learning algorithms, making it suitable for diverse datasets and classification problems:
- **Linear Algorithms**:
  - logistic regression: Ideal for binary or multiclass classification problems.
- **Non-Linear Algorithms**:
  - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: effective for both linear and non-linear data separation using kernel tricks (only linear is available on MSclassifR).
  - **Random Forests (RF)**: ensemble-based decision tree models that offer robust performance on complex datasets.
  - **Neural Networks (nnet)**: implements multilayer perceptrons for capturing intricate patterns in data.
  - **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: a high-performance gradient boosting method optimized for speed and accuracy.

### 2.4 Resampling Techniques for Imbalanced Data

To address challenges posed by imbalanced datasets, MSclassifR incorporates resampling methods:
- **Up-Sampling**: replicates minority class samples to match the majority class.
- **Down-Sampling**: reduces majority class samples to match the minority class.
- **SMOTE (Synthetic minority Over-sampling Technique)**: generates synthetic data points for the minority class using k-nearest neighbors.

These techniques are seamlessly integrated into model training functions like `LogReg` and `SelectionVar`, ensuring robust classification results even with imbalanced data.

### 2.5 Model Evaluation and Interpretation

MSclassifR provides extensive tools for evaluating model performance and interpreting results:
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - accuracy, Kappa, F1 Score, Adjusted Rand Index, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient.
  - cross-validation methods such as k-fold, repeated k-fold, and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) ensure reliable performance estimates&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
- **Confusion Matrices**:
  - summarize predictions versus actual outcomes, offering insights into classification accuracy and errors.
- **Visual Metrics**:
  - boxplots and summary tables of evaluation metrics allow users to compare models and select the most effective one.

### 2.6 Prediction and Classification

Trained models can be applied to new datasets using functions like `PredictLogReg` and `PredictFastClass`. These functions:
- match m/z values between the model and input spectra.
- provide category probabilities and assign predictions based on confidence scores.
- allow for tolerance adjustments to optimize peak matching.

### 2.7 Visualization Tools

MSclassifR includes robust visualization capabilities to aid interpretation:
- **Spectra Visualization (`PlotSpectra`)**:
  - visualizes raw and processed spectra, highlighting detected peaks and discriminant m/z values.
- **Performance Visualization**:
  - displays evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, and feature importance graphs for easy interpretation.
